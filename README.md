# JSML-Autoformat
A Sublime Text 3 plugin to help write faster JSML.

## Installing

JSML-Formatter should become available on Package Control soon.

## To Use

Use the keyboard command `ctrl-[` to create a new JSML array with one element, i.e.

```JavaScript

[
	{
		t: "p",
		T: "dorem ipsum",
	}
]

```

Use the keyboard command `ctrl-{` to create a new JSML element, i.e.

```JavaScript

{
	t: "p",
	T: "dorem ipsum",
}

```

Note, these shortcuts work only on `.jsml` files, to avoid confusion.

## Todo

* Add settings so that users can use the commands on any file they choose, as opposed to just `.jsml`
* Bug fixes
* Sublime Text 2 Support
* Implement linting of some sort
* Global domination
